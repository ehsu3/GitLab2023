# GitLab2023 - Ealynn and Jace
This project aims to help us learn more about the basics of Git and how to utilize it in a team environment. Through this project, Jace and I worked on figuring out how Git works and how programmers can collaborate using a Git repository to work on the same code simultaneously to aid efficient project development. 

This lab challenged our knowledge of Git and how to utilize it in a colalborative environment. Git is a tool used by many companies and this lab will assist us in the future, giving us an introduction to a tool used by many developers globally. 

Working on this lab was a good experience and really helped us learn the basics of Git and how to effectively use it when working with others on code, something we will definitely do in the future while working on future projects both in university and in the workplace. 

> From Lab: "In this activity, you will learn how to create a GitHub repo and use the terminal to perform many of the necessary actions required for working in a shared repository."

## What was Accomplished
Some of the things we learned to do in this lab were: 
* How to download and utilize GitBash on Windows
* Create a repository
* Use Git to clone a repository
* Use Git to transfer code written in Eclipse to the online Repository 
* Write a ReadMe file from GitHub
* Collaborate with someone using the same repository

## Git / Terminal Commands
* ls : Shows you your current directory
* git clone [file name here] : Clones the repository for use on local machines
* git add --all : Adds the code to a "queue" of sorts (all the code) to be added to the repository
* git commit -m 'message here' : Commits the changes on the local machine and allows the user to put a message explaining the changes. 
* git push : Pushes the changes to the online repository from a local machine :shipit:
* git status : Tells you where you are in reference to hte origin.
